# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - Utilis

This project is a utility of functions that assist in database EDA, and is constantly being improved.

## 1. Description  
**EDA Utilities** is a reusable and scalable Python module designed to streamline **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** across various domains. This toolkit simplifies **data loading, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis**, making the initial phases of any data science project more efficient and structured.  

With built-in **logging** and **custom exception handling**, the module ensures **reliable debugging and error tracking**, enabling seamless data exploration for datasets in **finance, healthcare, marketing, and more**.  

## 2. Technologies and Tools  
This project leverages **Python** and key **data science libraries**. The technologies and tools used were Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, logging anda os), Jupyter Notebook, Git and Github (version control), statistics, code runner (terminal) and Visual Studio Code (project development environment).

## 3. Project Objective  

This EDA framework was built to **accelerate** the data exploration phase while maintaining **data integrity and insights generation**.  

- **Automated Data Loading**: Easily handle `.csv` and `.xlsx` files  
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Handle missing values, convert dates, and format numerical values  
- **Statistical Insights**: Generate descriptive statistics, detect outliers, and compute variability metrics  
- **Powerful Visualizations**: Create histograms, boxplots, and bar charts with minimal effort  
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Ensure smooth debugging and structured exception reporting  
With this package, **data scientists can focus on insights rather than preprocessing**.

## 4. Next Steps  
This project is continuously evolving. The following features are planned for future versions:

- **Data Type Detection & Auto-Cleaning** - Automate the identification and handling of categorical, numerical, and datetime features.
- **Outlier Handling Options** - Expand strategies beyond IQR, such as Z-score and Isolation Forests.
- **Expand the project to be a general data science tool** - I also intend to develop utilities for machine learning modeling.
